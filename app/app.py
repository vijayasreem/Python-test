Here's a basic implementation of a Python Flask API for the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def evaluate_loan_application():
    # Parse request data
    data = request.get_json()

    # Validate applicant's documents
    if not verify_documents(data['identification'], data['proof_of_income'], data['credit_history'], data['employment_details']):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid documents provided'}), 400

    # Perform credit check
    credit_score = perform_credit_check(data['ssn'])

    # Evaluate creditworthiness
    if not evaluate_creditworthiness(credit_score, data['financial_history']):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Not eligible for loan'}), 200

    # Approve loan with specific terms and conditions
    loan_terms = approve_loan(data['loan_amount'], data['interest_rate'], data['repayment_period'])

    # Generate loan agreement
    loan_agreement = generate_loan_agreement(loan_terms)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application approved', 'loan_agreement': loan_agreement}), 200

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement document verification logic
    return True

def perform_credit_check(ssn):
    # TODO: Implement credit check logic using credit bureaus and financial institutions
    return 700  # Example credit score

def evaluate_creditworthiness(credit_score, financial_history):
    # TODO: Implement creditworthiness evaluation logic
    return True

def approve_loan(loan_amount, interest_rate, repayment_period):
    # TODO: Implement loan approval logic
    return {'loan_amount': loan_amount, 'interest_rate': interest_rate, 'repayment_period': repayment_period}

def generate_loan_agreement(loan_terms):
    # TODO: Implement loan agreement generation logic
    return 'Loan Agreement'  # Example loan agreement text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This Flask API defines a single endpoint `/loan/application` that expects a POST request containing the applicant's information in JSON format. It then performs the necessary steps to evaluate the loan application based on the acceptance criteria and returns the appropriate response.

Please note that the implementation of the document verification, credit check, creditworthiness evaluation, loan approval, and loan agreement generation logic is left as an exercise for you to complete. You can fill in these functions with your own implementation based on your specific requirements and existing systems.

Make sure to install Flask (`pip install flask`) before running the code. You can run the API using `python app.py` and test it using a tool like Postman or cURL.
