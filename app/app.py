Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()

    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Perform verification logic here
    is_eligible = verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

    # Generate report
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_employee(is_eligible)

    return jsonify({'is_eligible': is_eligible, 'report': report})

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are verified successfully, False otherwise
    return True

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Implement report generation logic here
    # Return a report indicating the eligibility status
    return "Eligible for loan" if is_eligible else "Not eligible for loan"

def notify_employee(is_eligible):
    # Implement notification logic here
    # Notify the bank employee about the eligibility status
    if is_eligible:
        print("Applicant is eligible for the loan")
    else:
        print("Applicant is not eligible for the loan")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan/verify` which accepts a POST request containing the applicant's documents (identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details). 

The `verify_loan_eligibility` function extracts the documents from the request payload and passes them to the `verify_documents` function, which performs the verification logic. The `verify_documents` function checks if all the documents are successfully verified and returns a boolean value indicating the eligibility status.

The `generate_report` function generates a report based on the eligibility status, and the `notify_employee` function notifies the bank employee about the eligibility status.

Finally, the API returns a JSON response containing the eligibility status and the generated report.

Please note that this code serves as a starting point and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements and data model.
